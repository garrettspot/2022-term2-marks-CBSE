# CBSE 2021-22 Term-2 Marks Calculator

A web application to calculate your Term 2 marks from the CBSE 2021-22 academic year based on your Term 1 and Final scores.

## About

During the 2021-22 academic year, CBSE conducted split term exams instead of the traditional single annual exam. While Term 1 and Final results were announced, students never received their Term 2 scores directly. This calculator helps you determine your Term 2 marks using the available information.

## How It Works

1. Enter your subject name (optional)
2. Input your Term 1 marks (out of 40 or 35)
3. Input your Final marks (out of 80 or 70)
4. Click "Calculate Marks" to see your Term 2 score

You need to click "Calculate Marks" each time to update it.
